## Installation

## Windows
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/)

We use Spyder in Anaconda Navigator for image processing.
Image processing libraries do not support new Python versions. That's why we install Python 3.8.6.

I am adding the required Python libraries as requirements.txt. You can install it using Cmd - pip3 or Anaconda Promp - conda if you want.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
